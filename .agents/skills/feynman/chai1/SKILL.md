# Chai-1

Use this skill for Chai-1-style biomolecular structure prediction and review.

Workflow:

1. Convert the research question into an input manifest with chains, sequences, ligands, nucleic acids, templates, restraints, and seeds.
2. Verify the available execution path before running: local model, managed endpoint, Modal job, SSH host, or documented remote API.
3. Capture package/model version, exact input manifest, hardware, command or request body, and all raw output files.
4. Save structure files and confidence artifacts in the active Feynman output folder.
5. Review chain coverage, interface confidence, ligand plausibility, stereochemistry warnings, and conflicts with known structures.

Use the structure as evidence only after the provenance and confidence checks are attached.
